Note on Plagiarism
------------------

Plagiarism is a serious offense that involves using another person's words or ideas without acknowledging the source of the information. This can be considered intellectual theft. All written work must be either your own or appropriately cited. Plagiarism can, at a minimum, result in a failing grade in this course.
